<p>You leap forward, slashing twice at the Behemoth. The Behemoth counters with a mighty blow.</p>

<p>You stand, daggers at the ready. The Behemoth bares its teeth at you.</p>

<p>Excellent choice! You charge off to beat up the Behemoth... but not before snatching these items.</p>

<p>You manage to steal successfully from the Behemoth. The question is, what is it?</p>

<p>You cast Fire at the Behemoth. It responds with Thunder.</p>

<p>Staff in hand, you stand in a ready stance. The Behemoth snarls.</p>

<p>Sword in hand, you stand in a ready stance. The Behemoth growls.</p>

<p>Your health is... well... how much health you have. If it drops below zero, it's game over. Don't worry, it's not
going to stay at 1. Since different jobs will have different amounts of health, you'll get the rest of your health
    after you click the link to begin the fight. The variable entitled Behemoth is how much health your foe has. You
    want this to drop to zero. Mana is required to use certain skills. Once it drops to zero... well, it's not game
    over, but you won't be able to use some skills. Once again, you'll get the rest of your mana after you begin the
    fight. Your Drivemeter will raise as you perform actions. Once it reaches ten, you will be able to perform an
    Overdrive attack. The Overdrive varies with each job.</p>
