        <p>As we could see from previous iterations, the generated stories are not very good, largely due to he events
            being very disjointed. The first step I took to try to improve this was to make the text much more
            granular. Rather than lumping entire events in the form of paragraphs together as the transitions, I
            broke each event down into individual sentences. This would allow the events generated to be a lot more
            specific to the overall story, rather than just having a couple of commonalities.</p>
        <p>An example of generated text with smaller pieces of source text can be seen
            <a href="../../../assets/static-pages/variegata-example4.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Whether or not that's an improvement is up to the reader. I personally thing it reads almost like a poem.</p>

        <h3 class="blog_topic"><strong>Playing with Data</strong></h3>
        <p>The next step was to try out different types of source text. Up until now, I have primarily been using
            the same pool of stories pulled from Choose Your Adventure. The downside to this is that there is not
            really any set grouping to those stories. They can be any genre, and deal with any topic. This can make
            it difficult to find acceptable ways to connect events across stories. To combat this, I tried using
            more specific source text to feed to the model. The first of which was a collection of Edgar Allen Poe's
            stories and poems.</p>
        <p>A story generated from Poe's works can be seen <a href="../../../assets/static-pages/variegata-example5.html"
                                                             target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>While still being fairly disjointed like before, using text entirely from a single author definitely
            makes the story feel a bit more comprehensive. All of the events generated are written in a similar
            style to each other, making them feel like they belong together - even if the actual content does not
            make a ton of sense when read out of context.</p>
        <p>There are a number of other data sets I am working on trying out to see how they compare, including wine
            reviews and news articles. These, however, are incredibly large compared to what I have already tried
            out, so the models are taking an extremely long time to be created. The model for the news articles is
            still being made as I write this. I may have to trim down the amount of data being processed if it does
            not end up working, but either way I will be trying out these different source texts.</p>

        <p>I have been asked to present my work so far on this project to WolverineSoft - the University of
            Michigan's video game design club. I have been preparing this presentation over the past few days and
            updating it with the up-to-date experiments. I plan on posting the slides here later this week, so stay
            tuned!</p>

        <h3 class="blog_topic"><strong>Moving Forward</strong></h3>
        <p>While I am happy to see that using a more niche source text improves the overall "feel" of the generated
            stories, I still want to make them work better. Over the next week, I plan on continuing to figure out
            ways to tweak the model and generator to make these stories feel more natural.</p>
