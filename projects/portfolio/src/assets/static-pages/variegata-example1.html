<div><table border="1"><tr><th>tree_id</th><td>http://chooseyourstory.com/story/viewer/default.aspx?StoryId=5587</td></tr><tr><th>first_story_block</th><td>Hello, adventurer! It seems that some random village has been beset by that big ol&#x27; beastie pictured over there.  Cute, isn&#x27;t he?

    Of course, being the hero that you are, it&#x27;s obviously your duty to fight it. So, what are you waiting for?

    First off, you&#x27;ll have to select your job. Your job affects what abilities you have.





     </td></tr><tr><th>action_results</th><td><table border="1"><thead><tr><th>action</th><th>result</th><th>action_results</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Warrior (Physical attacker)</td><td>Excellent choice!

If it drops below zero, it&#x27;s game over. Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not going to stay at 1. Since different jobs will have different amounts of health, you&#x27;ll get the rest of your health after you click the link to begin the fight.

    The variable entitled Behemoth is how much health your foe has. You want this to drop to zero.

    Mana is required to use certain skills. Once it drops to zero... well, it&#x27;s not game over, but you won&#x27;t be able to use some skills. Once again, you&#x27;ll get the rest of your mana after you begin the fight.

    Your Drivemeter will raise as you perform actions. Once it reaches ten, you will be able to perform an Overdrive attack. The Overdrive varies with each job.

    You also determine that the Behemoth is allergic to Scan by experience when it lets out a mighty sneeze in your direction. Although it doesn&#x27;t do that much damage, it&#x27;s still pretty annoying.</td></tr><tr><th>action_results</th><td><ul><li>None</li></ul></td></tr></table></li><li><table border="1"><tr><th>action</th><td>Steal</td></tr><tr><th>result</th><td>You attempt to steal from the Behemoth...</td></tr><tr><th>action_results</th><td><table border="1"><thead><tr><th>action</th><th>result</th><th>action_results</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Were you successful?</td><td>Your attempt is unsuccessful.
