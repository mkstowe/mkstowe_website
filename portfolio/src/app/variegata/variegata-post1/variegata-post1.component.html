        <h3 class="blog_topic"><strong>Stakeholder Information</strong></h3>
        <p>While any stakeholders in the entertainment industry could benefit from research such as this, I am
            gearing it more toward video game designers. Video games, often more so than other story-based media,
            requires a less-than-linear story to be available to the consumer. As a result, designers of these video
            games would have a greater need for a tool to help keep those stories interesting and engaging for the
            player.</p>
        <p>People who love video games, myself included, value an intricate plot that can change depending on the
            player's choices. This interactivity leads to re-playability, making the game more valuable in the eyes
            of the customer. Putting funds, designers' knowledge, and ample technology into research to create
            increasingly intriguing stories benefits all parties involved.</p>

        <h3 class="blog_topic"><strong>Market Information</strong></h3>
        <p>The market sector most closely related to this project would be the Communication Services sector -
            specifically the Media and Entertainment branch.</p>
        <p>As of 2018, the Media and Entertainment industry is worth about $703 billion. [<a
                href="https://investmentbank.com/media-and-entertainment-industry-overview/" target="_blank">source</a>]
        </p>
        <p>In October of 2020, this industry had approximately 1.74 million employees. [<a
                href="https://www.bls.gov/data/" target="_blank">source</a>]</p>
        <p>The five largest companies in this industry are Comcast, The Walt Disney Co., Charter Communications,
            ViacomCBS, and Bollor√© SA. [<a

                    target="_blank">source</a>]
        </p>
        <p>There are some products that attempt to do similar things as this project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://play.aidungeon.io/main/landing" target="_blank">AI Dungeon</a> is an automatic text
                adventure game.</li>
            <li>Botnick Studios created a tool for creating a story one word at a time, including the classic <a
                    href="https://botnik.org/content/harry-potter.html" target="_blank">Harry Potter and the
                Portrait of what Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash</a>.</li>
            <li>This <a href="https://www.plot-generator.org.uk/" target="_blank">plot generator</a> uses a
                Mad Libs-style approach to story generation.</li>
            <li>Predictive text on many smartphones that predicts what you plan on typing next.</li>
            <li>Google's Smart Compose that, like predictive text, suggests what to say next when writing emails or
            docs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of these products use similar ideas to generate stories or information based on the context given.
            These types of products can always be improved to generate text that makes more grammatical sense, or
            transition from one element to another more seamlessly.</p>

        <h3 class="blog_topic"><strong>Existing Research</strong></h3>
        <p>The following are some relevant papers from previous research that I hope will guide this project.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5805784A/en" target="_blank">US5805784A - Computer story
                generation system and method using network of re-usable substories</a>
                <p>Patent for a method of generating a story based on smaller substories. This method breaks a
                    substory consisting of a few sentences into a matrix defining features such as who is involved,
                    what specific topics they are saying, what specific events are happening, etc. This matrix allows
                    characters and scenarios to be reusable, scenarios to be seamlessly transitioned between, and chosen
                    by the algorithm on the fly during user-interaction.

                Crowdsourced Plot Graphs</a>
                <p>This paper uses a crowdsourced corpus of narrative examples of a new domain, a model can be
                    automatically constructed to allow for samples to be taken based on desired criteria. A plot
                    graph can then be constructed using this model to show the potential flow of the story. This
                    graph includes required and optional events, events that strictly rely on one another, and
                    events that must be mutually exclusive. Using this graph allows for a generated story from
                    beginning to end that has relatively few inconsistencies.

                Neural Model for Automated Story Generation</a>
                <p>This paper focuses more on using a predefined character, context, and action to generate an
                    event. The researchers compare quality of events generated with and without using these
                    predefined traits as input. It was found that providing the characters-centric information
                    from the beginning significantly increases a story's consistency and explainability.</p></li>

                Representations for Automated Story Generation with Deep Neural Nets</a>
                <p>Using neural nets, these researchers use methods for converting basic information of an event
                    into a sentence and vice versa. Starting with the original sentences, the method breaks them
                    down in multiple steps, calculating a measurement for perplexity at each stage. It was found
                    that they were able to automatically break the input down into general elements and
                    significantly reduce the perplexity, allowing the generated event to be built up once again
                    into new sentences to be added to the story.</p></li>

                Data-driven Approach to Story Generation</a>
                <p>This paper takes a look at breaking down an input sentence or story and restructuring the
                    various elements into a tree that can be traversed to create a new story. This allows a
                    single data structure that can be reused to generate new scenarios each time depending on the
                    path taken during the traversal. This method was found to produce stories that lack much
                    variation from one another, and rather boring plots.</p></li>
