        <p>The main technologies used for this step include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python/Flask</li>

        <h3 class="blog_topic"><strong>Search Engine</strong></h3>
        <p>Using the scikit-learn library, I was able to implement a basic search engine for the stored events. This
            engine uses the TF-IDF technique that many search engines use. With this, I am able to use the keywords
            generated from the inter-graph model discussed last week, and query the engine to find which events most
            closely match the keywords. We are finally generating full stories using all events available from our
            database! They are still a bit rough and definitely some fine tuning, but at least the final structure of
            the generator is pretty much working.</p>

        <h3 class="blog_topic"><strong>PyInstaller</strong></h3>
        <p>Because the generator is now using a much larger dataset and large files for the model and search engine
            vectorizer, my hosting server is having more and more difficulty properly running the generator as a web
            app. In order to avoid dealing with more tools to get it to work online, I have decided to bundle the
            application as a downloadable executable. This allows it to be more modular and to run much more
            smoothly. To do this, I used <a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/" target="_blank">PyInstaller</a>
            . This tool basically
            wraps all of the needed data files,
            dependencies, and application code into one easy-to-use executable.</p>

        <p>As always, getting things to work out of the box never happens, so I had to spend a bit of time getting
            PyInstaller
            to get along with my code. There were some issues getting certain dependencies to properly get packaged so
            that the executable could run. I kept running into odd errors that seemed unrelated to the tasks I was
            trying to accomplish (many of which others online have also experienced). I managed to find a newer
            development version that takes care of some of these, and got everything to work.</p>

        <h3 class="blog_topic"><strong>Moving Forward</strong></h3>
        <p>As can be seen in the currently generated stories, there tend to be some repeated events due to keywords
            bouncing back and forth between each other. There is also the problem of some stories not going across
            different source stories, but rather all generated events being too closely related. I plan on looking
            into ways to avoid this, and to add more variety to what is created.</p>
