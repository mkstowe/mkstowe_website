<p>You are Linda Niles, at just 19 you have become one of the most famous singers on the planet, your career started
    at 15
    and you have enjoyed rave reviews, record breaking sales and all the fans a person could want. In addition, you have
    managed to avoid scandals and developing an ego, which have destroyed countless other singer careers, you live a
    life
    most dream of. Another typical day of your life, you are to make an appearance at the Destiny Hill Mall located in
    Destiny Hill, New Jersey. Recently you have become the spokeswoman, for Zidane's clothing and you are there to
    promote
    the opening of their newest store. They are a hoity toity clothing store that is hoping your endorsement will have
    people buy from them despite their outrageous prices. You arrive at the mall around noon in a inconspicuous car so
    the
    dozens of people waiting around outside don't notice you. The car stops in in the employee parking lot, you get out
    and
    sneak in through the employee entrance which is surround by half dozen police officers. Once inside you head up a
    flight
    of stairs, hearing the screaming of your fans, there must be hundreds of them. This doesn't bother you as you've had
    countless concerts that had as much 20,000 fans so it's actually more quiet then normal. At the top of the steps is
    the
    back exit to Zidane's, you knock and a giant mall security guard opens and lets you in. Heading towards the front of
    the
    store past the expensive clothes is a chair and a table with markers and a stack of photos of yourself. The
    screaming
    fans are kept outside and become even louder when they see you. A few more security guards are standing beside you
    as
    you take your seat. Along with them is Steve your lifelong photographer who has his camera on a tripod ready to take
    your picture with the fans. Police officers stand outside the store as the door's open letting the noise enter the
    store, which is unpleasant to the guards but not you. The first few fans come in and it is a pretty routine affair.
    You
    ask their name, you sign an autograph, they tell how great you are while trying contain their excitement, you take a
    picture with them and they leave. No matter how many times you've done this, you avoid going on auto pilot. You
    remain
    sincere and genuine for every fan, no doubt a factor to your success. The next fan that comes appears to be a bit
    uneasy, He's looks just one or two years older then you, he has fair skin and short black hair that he keeps
    nervously
    scratching and light brown eyes that seem to be intentionally looking away from you. You've dealt with people who
    were
    nervous in your presence before and have dealt with people a bit socially awkward, this guy however was different,
    you
    don't know why but your gut is telling you something is off. He approaches the table, you could have security kick
    him
    out or you could sign the autograph and just get this over with</p>

<p>"Really? The other men I talked to seemed to think it was. Anyway, thank you. Please, go eat." You nod, and quickly
    return to eat. You have to punch one of the smaller Orcs, but you manage to grab a large, juicy piece of meat and
    eagerly chew into it.</p>

<p>Pretty brave of you, let’s see if it works. You sit far away from her and answer her, while trying not to stare too
    hard. “Oh, well I’m sorta doing okay I guess…” “You seem troubled, what’s wrong?” “Nothing really, I’m just trying
    to…(sigh) I’ll be honest. I’ve been severely addicted to anime for years and I’ve just now started to go cold turkey
    and
    it’s been harder than I thought.” This confessional is about the only thing you could think of to talk about that
    wouldn’t cause her to call the cops on you. And that’s still a possibility. Stay the course fatty, stay the fucking
    course! “Wow, that’s pretty commendable of you. I remember that you were all into that anime stuff the last time we
    had
    a family gathering. Even though I was young even I thought you were a bit obsessed with it.” “Yeah I dunno how I’m
    going
    to make it…” you say trying to fight the urge to say anything inappropriate. “Maybe you should try this.” Patricia
    says
    and opens up her bookbag. She throws a comic book at you. It’s one of those superhero ones. AMERICAN superheroes!
    Like
    superman and such. You’re taken off guard and forget about your unnatural feelings for a moment. “Superman?” “Yeah,
    maybe if you read some other comics it will help ease your transition. The only thing is, you could get addicted to
    those, so be careful.” “Y’know, this could work. I never really was interested in these types before, so I probably
    won’t get too attached.” “And unlike the anime shit, you got more of a variety meaning you’re less likely to get
    obsessed with one thing. I mean the characters are at least different from each other in looks and stuff.” “This is
    a
    great idea! I just wish I had some money to go down to the comic shop and try this out!” “Here, take these. I never
    bother rereading them.” Patricia says handing you a bunch of superhero comics. “Alright! Thanks!” you say and run
    down
    to the basement. It’s funny, but the fact that Patricia was into comics didn’t make you more aroused like it would
    most
    loser geeks. It might be due to the fact that you were so thankful that someone was not only willing to talk to you,
    but
    help you that caused you to no longer look at her with nearly overwhelming lust. Okay, so after you read them, you
    DO
    spend an inordinate amount of time rubbing the comics on yourself and enjoying her “scent” and think about her while
    you
    jack off a little bit. But you still feel a little better, like the obsession has lessened a little. Patricia comes
    over
    several more times as your Mom tutors her and she brings you more comics. You appreciate it, but eventually she
    doesn’t
    need anymore tutoring and you miss her and the comics especially since the comics were working. You get depressed
    and
    mope around the house, but your Mom is quite tired of you in general at this point. “Look, I know you’re trying to
    beat
    your fucking addiction, but you’re taking too fucking long about it! If you’re going to insist on being a man-child
    that
    lives in my goddamn basement forever, the least you can do is go and get a fucking job! In fact you ARE going to get
    one, or I’m kicking your fat ass out!” Since you don’t have much of a choice, you leave the house for the first time
    in
    a long time. The sunlight burns your pasty skin and eyes, but you waddle down the street in your quest to find a
    job.
    The problem is, you don’t even know where to look, so you just end up going to the comic shop to read them without
    paying. Jake the comic shop owner sees you enter and is really surprised. “Brian is that you? Shit man, thought you
    might’ve died of a heart attack or gotten arrested for having child porn on your computer har har har har! Where
    have
    you been? You’ve missed several issues of your favorite Japanese shit.” “Yeah, well that’s why I haven’t been here,
    I
    destroyed my entire collection. I’ve quit it cold turkey, but it hasn’t been easy.” “Shit, that’s almost hard to
    believe, but then again you never were one to miss an issue before, so I guess you’re telling the truth. But what
    brings
    you back here?” “I dunno, my mom told me to look for a job or she’s going to kick me out. I dunno what I’m going to
    do.”
    “Well, you could work here, I need someone to lug around the comic boxes. I’m going to be doing some rearranging.”
    “What? Are you serious, I thought Ron did that.” “Ron’s fuckin’ dead. Found the asshole dead with a broken neck in
    my
    fucking bathroom! He was looking at one of those sex comics and the dumb ass decided to try autoerotic asphyxiation.
    I
    swear that’s the last time I hire a retard.” This could be an opportunity to save yourself from being homeless, or
    it
    could be a relapse back into your former addiction. Remember, you’d be working right at the source.</p>

<p>Wise choice! Everyone knows 10,000 in Mexican currency is only $2.00 US currency! After waiting for a better deal you
    finally get an offer of $10,000 from some rich lesbian in Hawaii. Jackpot! Apparently she also wants to meet your
    Mom in
    person. You know your Mom's been kinda lonely after Dad was killed in that "elephant incident" so you decide to set
    it
    up... And after months of workin', proddin', fixin', and schemin' on your part, your Mom is now a much happier
    person
    and so are you having a rich stepmom and all. Now you can go buy that bomb shelter you always wanted.</p>

<p>More information floods in. Archery tips, hunting tips, how to bake the perfect cake, the location of every map of

    or bad.</p>

<p>Escape into the Abyss Faces. Horrible faces flood into your mind. Creatures of such immense size and power they could
    purge your world from existence with less strength that you use in breathing. But they're not going to do that. You
    can
    tell what they're going to do. They're going to cause a pain so unbearable, so unimaginable, to even contemplate how
    bad
    it is might be driving you insane. They've noticed you. They've noticed you learning about them, learning what man
    was
    not meant to know. They're coming. Everything you love is going to pay for your curiosity. You rip off the helmet,
    drawing your bone dagger. You quickly plunge it into Blaise's heart, killing her instantly. Thank the Gods. You've
    saved
    her from the pain. You turn the blade around and plunge it through your own heart as you escape into the abyss.</p>

<p>You pay Tabernius, and he offers you the helmet. "This helmet will give you massive amounts of knowledge, some of
    which
    might be... detrimental to your health. Put it on for as long as you want." You nod, and put on the helmet.
    Knowledge
    floods into your mind. Sailing Tips flood into your mind, before every Speech written by the Kings of the Kingdom of
    Man. A brief bit of information about the lifespan, diet and nature of Turtles hits you.</p>
